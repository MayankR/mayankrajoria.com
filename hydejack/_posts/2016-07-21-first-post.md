Hey, there!
This is the first post on my blog. The customary ‘Hello, World!’ one. I shall hopefully post about things that interest me, on this blog.
In the next blog post I shall probably describe the setup of my website an this blog. I am using AWS entirely for hosting. This will probably reduce costs and I will learn about new stuff too. Stay tuned for next updates.

Signing Off,
Mayank
