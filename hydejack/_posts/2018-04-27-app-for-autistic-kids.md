It was December 2017, the penultimate semester of my undergrad was over and I was placed in a great company hrough the campus placement. However the feeling of not having contributed much to the society was nagging me somewhere. While I was browsing through my IITD mailbox, I jumped to take part in the first opportunity I found. Several projects were being taken up by The National Trust of India and IITD in a joint venture. I signed up for it.

It turned out among the many projects to spread awareness about autism and promote inclusiveness, one of them was to develop an Android app. This app would help children children having autism communicate better using a flashcard like interface. I, along with a team of 5 others were selected for this project. It turned out there were already some apps existing for this very same problem, but they were not "Indianized" enough. The requirement was to have an app that would have the local variations of the common words (eg. "biscuit" instead of "cookeies") and have its UI primarily in Hindi. We also wanted the app to be free of charge so that families from any financial backgroud could use it.

## Planning the app

Our first step was to understand the problem and the requirements of the app. Naturally we decided to meet the teachers of a special school, Action For Autism. We went there for a day, observed the kids and how they interacted with the teachers. We then also used the current similar apps in the market and took feedback from the teachers and parents. As a result we had several points, features and a good idea of how we should proceed with the development.

We realized we needed to solve the following:-
- Have an app which helps kids communicate by tapping on word tiles in app
- Keep the words in India context
- Support the Hindi language for UI
- Be customizable

We brainstormed that these could be solved by:-
- Having a decluttered and very simple UI
- Have a default Text to Speech (TTS) for each tile to speak the word out.
- Do a comprehensive study of commonly spoken words and actions by Indian kids and include them in the app.
- Allow kid's caretaker to add new word tiles
- Allow chaning of picture on the tile
- Allow recording of voice for a tile

I being the only one with a Computer Science background in the team decided to take up the responsibility for overseeing the app development.
